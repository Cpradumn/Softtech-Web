        C# (/si ʃɑːrp/ see sharp)[b] is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. 
        C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, 
        generic, object-oriented (class-based),and component-oriented programming disciplines.
        The C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and was later approved as an 
        international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .
        NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. 
        Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime 
        environment for the C# programming language.
        A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), 
all of which support C# and are free, open-source, 
        and cross-platform. Mono also joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET.
